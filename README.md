#### Page screenshot

This code snippet navigates to whatsmyuseragent.org in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, and saves 3 screenshots.

```java
import com.microsoft.playwright.*;

import java.nio.file.Paths;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class PageScreenshot {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Playwright playwright = Playwright.create();
    List<BrowserType> browserTypes = Arrays.asList(
        playwright.chromium(),
        playwright.webkit(),
        playwright.firefox()
    );
    for (BrowserType browserType : browserTypes) {
      Browser browser = browserType.launch(
          new BrowserType.LaunchOptions().withHeadless(false));
      BrowserContext context = browser.newContext(
          new Browser.NewContextOptions().withViewport(800, 600));
      Page page = context.newPage();
      page.navigate("http://whatsmyuseragent.org/");
      page.screenshot(new Page.ScreenshotOptions().withPath(Paths.get("screenshot-" + browserType.name() + ".png")));
      browser.close();
    }
    playwright.close();
  }
}
```
