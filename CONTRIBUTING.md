## How to Contribute

### Getting Code

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-java
cd playwright-java
```

2. Download playwright-cli binary package into `driver/` directory and run `install` command. It will install Playwright and download browser binaries for Chromium, Firefox and WebKit.

```bash
mkdir driver
cd driver
FILENAME=playwright-cli-0.160.0-next.1604373941495-linux.zip
curl -O  https://playwright.azureedge.net/builds/cli/next/${FILENAME}
unzip ${FILENAME} -d .
./playwright-cli install
```
Replace `-linux.zip` in the file name with `-win32_x64.zip` or `-mac.zip` for other platforms.

Names of published driver archives can be found at https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli/actions

### Compiling and running the tests with Maven

```bash
mvn compile
mvn test
```

### Generating API

Public Java API is generated from [api.json](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-java/blob/master/api-generator/src/main/resources/api.json) which in turn is created by `playwright-cli print-api-json`.

### Code Style

- We try to follow [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
- Comments should be generally avoided. If the code would not be understood without comments, consider re-writing the code to make it self-explanatory.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Commit Messages

1. *label* is one of the following:
    - `fix` - playwright bug fixes.
    - `feat` - playwright features.
    - `docs` - changes to docs, e.g. `docs(api.md): ..` to change documentation.
    - `test` - changes to playwright tests infrastructure.
    - `devops` - build-related work, e.g. CI related patches and general changes to the browser build infrastructure
    - `chore` - everything that doesn't fall under previous categories
2. *namespace* is put in parenthesis after label and is optional. Must be lowercase.
3. *title* is a brief summary of changes.
4. *description* is **optional**, new-line separated from title and is in present tense.
5. *footer* is **optional**, new-line separated from *description* and contains "fixes" / "references" attribution to github issues.
