## How to Contribute

### Getting Code

1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-java
cd playwright-java
```

2. Checkout and install playwright-cli node.js package into `driver/` directory

### Generating API

Public Java API is generated from [api.json](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-java/blob/master/api-generator/src/main/resources/api.json) which in turn is created by [`npm run generate-api-json`](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/blob/2df6425254232125e46347d5e8cddd71c3cecce6/package.json#L29).

### Code Style

- We try to follow [Google Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html)
- Comments should be generally avoided. If the code would not be understood without comments, consider re-writing the code to make it self-explanatory.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.

### Commit Messages

1. *label* is one of the following:
    - `fix` - playwright bug fixes.
    - `feat` - playwright features.
    - `docs` - changes to docs, e.g. `docs(api.md): ..` to change documentation.
    - `test` - changes to playwright tests infrastructure.
    - `devops` - build-related work, e.g. CI related patches and general changes to the browser build infrastructure
    - `chore` - everything that doesn't fall under previous categories
2. *namespace* is put in parenthesis after label and is optional. Must be lowercase.
3. *title* is a brief summary of changes.
4. *description* is **optional**, new-line separated from title and is in present tense.
5. *footer* is **optional**, new-line separated from *description* and contains "fixes" / "references" attribution to github issues.
